quality in an elegant framework, it is less clear what they learn about
language. Recent work has started evaluating the quality of vector
representations learned by NMT models on morphological and syntactic tasks. In
this paper, we investigate the representations learned at different layers of
NMT encoders. We train NMT systems on parallel data and use the models to
extract features for training a classifier on two tasks: part-of-speech and
semantic tagging. We then measure the performance of the classifier as a proxy
to the quality of the original NMT model for the given task. Our quantitative
analysis yields interesting insights regarding representation learning in NMT
models. For instance, we find that higher layers are better at learning
semantics while lower layers tend to be better for part-of-speech tagging. We
also observe little effect of the target language on source-side
representations, especially in higher quality models.},

 abstract = {In Neural Machine Translation (NMT), each word is represented as a
low-dimension, real-value vector for encoding its syntax and semantic
information. This means that even if the word is in a different sentence
context, it is represented as the fixed vector to learn source representation.
Moreover, a large number of Out-Of-Vocabulary (OOV) words, which have different
syntax and semantic information, are represented as the same vector
representation of "unk". To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel
context-aware smoothing method to dynamically learn a sentence-specific vector
for each word (including OOV words) depending on its local context words in a
sentence.  The learned context-aware representation is integrated into the NMT
to improve the translation performance. Empirical results on NIST

1.78 BLEU improvements on average over a strong attentional NMT, and
outperforms some existing systems.},

performance in recent years.  Yet, there are some existing issues that Neural
Machine Translation still does not solve completely. Two of them are
translation for long sentences and the \enquote{over-translation}. To address
these two problems, we propose an approach that utilize more grammatical
information such as syntactic dependencies, so that the output can be generated
based on more abundant information. In our approach, syntactic dependencies is
employed in decoding. In addition, the output of the model is presented not as
a simple sequence of tokens but as a linearized tree construction. In order to
assess the performance, we construct model based on an attention mechanism
encoder-decoder model in which the source language is input to the encoder as a
sequence and the decoder generates the target language as a linearized
dependency tree structure. Experiments on the Europarl-v7 dataset of
French-to-English translation demonstrate that our proposed method improves
BLEU scores by 1.57 and 2.40 on datasets consisting of sentences with up to 50

performance on the practically important task of sentence classification (Kim, 2014; Kalchbrenner et al., 2014; Johnson and Zhang, 2014; Zhang et al., 2016).
However, these models require practitioners to specify an exact model
architecture and set accompanying hyperparameters, including the filter region
size, regularization parameters, and so on. It is currently unknown
how sensitive model performance is to changes in these configurations for the
task of sentence classification. We thus conduct a sensitivity analysis of
one-layer CNNs to explore the effect of architecture components on model
performance; our aim is to distinguish between important
and comparatively inconsequential design decisions for sentence classification.
We focus on one-layer CNNs (to the exclusion of more complex models) due to
their comparative simplicity and strong empirical performance, which makes it a
modern standard baseline method akin to Support Vector Machine (SVMs) and
logistic regression. We derive practical advice from our extensive empirical
results for those interested in getting the most out of CNNs for sentence
classification in real world settings.},

We study a method to leverage syntactic information without explicitly building

standard syntactic treebanks, and then leveraging its hidden encoder layers
when analysing tweets. Such hidden vectors do not contain explicit syntactic

 abstract = {In this paper we propose a lightly-supervised framework to rapidly build text
classifiers for contextual advertising. Traditionally text classification
techniques require labeled training documents for each predefined class. In the
scenario of contextual advertising, advertisers often want to target to a
specific class of webpages most relevant to their product or service, which may
not be covered by a pre-trained classifier. Moreover, the advertisers are
interested in whether a webpage is ``relevant'' or ``irrelevant''. It is
time-consuming to solicit the advertisers for reliable training signals for the
negative class. Therefore, it is more suitable to model the problem as a
one-class classification problem, in contrast to traditional classification
problems where disjoint classes are defined a priori.
We first apply two state-of-the-art lightly-supervised classification models, generalized expectation (GE) criteria (Druck et al., 2008) and multinomial
naive Bayes (MNB) with priors (Settles, 2011) to one-class classification where
the user only needs to provide a small list of labeled words for the target
class. To combine the strengths of the two models, we fuse them together by
using MNB to automatically enrich the constraints for GE training. We also
explore ensemble method to combine classifiers. On a corpus of webpages from
real-time bidding requests, the proposed GE1\^{} MNB1 model achieves the highest
average F1 of 0.69 and closes more than half of the gap between previous
stateof- the-art lightly-supervised models to a fully-supervised MaxEnt model.},

its fidelity to the source can be confirmed or denied. In this paper, we
develop a new NLP task: determining the verifiability of an attribution based
on linguistic cues.  We operationalize the notion of verifiability as a score
between 0 and 1 using human judgments in a comparison-based approach.  Using
crowdsourcing, we create a dataset of verifiability-scored attributions, and
demonstrate a model that achieves an RMSE of 0.057 and Spearman's rank
correlation of 0.95 to human-generated scores. We discuss the application of
this technique to the analysis of mass media.},

as personality, can be built by using the Facebook language of social media
users in conjunction with their responses to psychology questionnaires. It is
challenging to apply these models to make general predictions about attributes

it requires 1. the potentially inavailability of the original training data

Twitter/county data is available. TSDA corrects for the different word
distributions between Facebook and Twitter and for the varying word
distributions across counties by adjusting target side word frequencies; no
changes to the trained model are made. In the case of predicting the Big Five
county-level personality traits, TSDA outperforms a state-of-the-art domain
adaptation method, gives county-level predictions that have fewer extreme
outliers, higher year-to-year stability, and higher correlation with

 abstract = {Hierarchical attention networks have recently achieved remarkable performance
for document classification in a given language.  However, when multilingual
document collections are considered, training such models separately for each
language entails linear parameter growth and lack of cross-language transfer.
Learning a single multilingual model with fewer parameters is therefore a
challenging but potentially beneficial objective. To this end, we propose
multilingual hierarchical attention networks for learning document structures, with shared encoders and/or shared attention mechanisms across languages, using
multi-task learning and an aligned semantic space as input.  We evaluate the
proposed models on multilingual document classification with disjoint label
sets, on a large dataset which we provide, with 600k news documents in 8
languages, and 5k labels.  The multilingual models outperform monolingual ones
in low-resource as well as full-resource settings, and use fewer parameters, thus confirming their computational efficiency and the utility of
cross-language transfer.},

 abstract = {In this work we investigate how role-based behavior profiles of a Wikipedia
editor, considered against the backdrop of roles taken up by other editors in
discussions, predict the success of the editor at achieving an impact on the
associated article.
We first contribute a new public dataset including a task predicting the
success of Wikipedia editors involved in discussion, measured by an
operationalization of the lasting impact of their edits in the article.
We then propose a probabilistic graphical model that advances earlier work
inducing latent discussion roles using the light supervision of success in the
negotiation task.
We evaluate the performance of the model and interpret findings of roles and
group configurations that lead to certain outcomes on Wikipedia.},
