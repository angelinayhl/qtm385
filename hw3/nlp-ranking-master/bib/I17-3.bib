A synchronous grammar pattern describes a grammar pattern in the target
language (e.g., English) and its counterpart in an other language (e.g., Mandarin), serving the purpose of native language support.
Our method involves identifying the grammar patterns in the target language, aligning these patterns with the target language patterns, and finally
filtering valid SGPs.
The extracted SGPs with examples are then used to develop a prototype  writing
assistant system, called WriteAhead/bilingual.
Evaluation on a set of randomly selected SGPs shows that our system provides
